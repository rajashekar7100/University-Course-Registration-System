In my project I'm submitting my Java Code with name 
-UniveristyDatabase.Zip file,along with 
-University.sql file, and 
-Report.doc file.
Step 1: As I have done the backend of this project in Java
        using Netbeans Import this UniversityDatabase.zip file 
        in Netbeans.
		You can just download Netbeans from the link: https://netbeans.org/downloads/
		Then importing the Zip file which is then run.
Step 2: As I have used XAMPP control panel to design my database
        Downlaod link: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
        After installation import the sql files which is attached.
Step 3: To establish connection with mysql database project requires mysql-connector.jar. 
		It is necessary to import that jar file in your netbeans project as external jars.
		I have also attached that jar file in my zip.
Step 4: As soon the connection is established run the project which will be directed to MainPage.jsp
        where you can see Login and New User Page. Click on New User then Enter the registration details 
        then submit.
Step 5: Then cross check weather it is saved in user table or not and also check weather it is updated in concerned table.
Step 6: Then login with that user details and then check.
